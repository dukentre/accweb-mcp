# Assetto Corsa Competizione Server Web Interface

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dukentre/accweb-mcp)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dukentre/accweb-mcp)

ACCWeb MCP is a fork of [assetto-corsa-web/accweb](https://github.com/assetto-corsa-web/accweb) for managing Assetto Corsa Competizione servers via a web interface, Docker Compose, and a token-protected MCP endpoint. You can start, stop and configure server instances, monitor their status, and let MCP clients inspect or update server parameters.

## Installation and configuration

accweb is installed by extracting the zip on your server, modifing the YAML configuration file to your needs and starting it in a terminal.

### Manuall installation

1. download the latest release from the release section on GitHub
2. extract the zip file on your server
3. edit the `config.yml` to match your needs
4. open a terminal
5. change directory to the accweb installation location
6. start accweb using `./accweb` on Linux and `accweb.exe` on Windows
   - By using --config (-c) you can point to an alternative `config.yml` file, e.g. `./accweb --config server1.yml`
8. leave the terminal open (or start in background using screens on Linux for example)
9. visit the server IP/domain and port you've configured, for example: http://example.com:8080

I recommend to setup an SSL certificate, but that's out of scope for this instructions. You can enable a certificate inside the `config.yml`.

**Note that you have to install [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) if you're on Linux.**

## Docker

This fork includes a compose-based deployment for running ACCWeb with Wine.
Place the ACC Dedicated Server files on the host and mount them into the
container.

Quick start:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p accserver
# copy the ACC Dedicated Server installation into ./accserver
docker compose up -d --build
```

The default expected layout is:

```text
./accserver/server/accServer.exe
```

The compose stack builds `accweb/accweb`, which contains ACCWeb plus Wine.

See [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for the full layout, volumes, ports and
update flow.

The Docker setup also exposes a token-protected MCP endpoint at `/mcp` for
agents and MCP clients. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

Upstream Docker Hub image:

https://hub.docker.com/r/accweb/accweb

## Backup

To backup your files, copy and save the `config` directory as well as the `config.yml`. The `config` directory can later be placed inside the new accweb version directory and you can adjust the new `config.yml` based on your old configuration (don't overwrite it, there meight be breaking changes).

## Contribute and support

If you like to contribute, have questions or suggestions you can open tickets and pull requests on GitHub.

All Go code must have been run through go fmt. The frontend and backend changes must be (manually) tested on your system. If you have issues running it locally open a ticket.

To run the accweb locally is really simple, make sure that the attribute `dev` is set to true in your `config.yml` file.

### Frontend development environment

Our current frontend was built using Vue.js and can be found inside `public` directory.

To run the watcher use the following command.

```shell
make run-dev-frontend
```
Then when you edit any js file, the watcher will detect and rebuild the js package.

### Backend development environment

ACCweb backend is running over golang and can be found inside `internal` directory.

Use the following command to run the backend on your terminal.

```shell
make run-dev-backend
```
Keep in mind that you need to restart the command for see the changes that you made in the code working (or not :zany_face:) 

### Visual Studio Code - Remote container

There is a pre-built development environment setup for ACCWeb for Visual Studio Code and Remote Containers. Please, check here how to setup and use: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

## Build release

To build a release, execute the `build_release.sh` script (on Linux) or follow the steps inside the script. You need to pass the build version as the first parameter. Example:
To build a release, execute the `build_release.sh` script (on Linux) or follow the steps inside the script. You need to pass the build version as the first parameter. Example:

```shell
./build/build_release.sh 1.2.3
```

This will create a directory `releases/accweb_1.2.3` containing the release build of accweb. This directory can be zipped, uploaded to GitHub and deployed on a server.
